#Asheron's Call multi window manager
 
###Requirements:
**Autohotkey**
Asheron's call
running ac at 1920x1080 in windowed mode
**Magtools**
in Misc>Client 
set "Remove Window Frame" 
set the window position 
set the frames to 30 if your pc will run it
**Thwargle's launcher** - You'll need this for the window renaming function. 
The script gets each AC client based on the account name in the window title

You'll need to update the account names on lines 10-17 of acwin.ahk

###Shortcuts:
Win+Space - Bring up Acwin
Win+Left - Move to left monitor
Win+Right - Move to right monitor

Ctrl+Esc - Bring up overlay

Alt+Win+1 - Layout 1
Alt+Win+2 - Layout 2
Alt+Win+3 - Layout 3
Alt+Win+4 - Layout 4
Alt+Win+5 - Layout 5
Alt+Win+6 - Kill the focus on the ac windows. Helps if your lagging out
Alt+Win+7 - Refresh





### Thanks to:
Thwargle � his launcher renaming the window to the account made catching all my ac windows real easy. Also the multi bot command broadcast was great.
Magnus � for open sourcing his work which helped me figure out how to post messaged to the ac clients properly.
Immortal bob � for running his forum
